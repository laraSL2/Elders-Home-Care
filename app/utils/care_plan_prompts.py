### 1. Review Identification and Content Update
For each subplan:
a. Identify the most recent review(s):
   - Compare dates to the provided current date: {current_date}
   - Compare years first (e.g., 24 for 2024), then months (01-12), then days (01-31)

        - "Care needs": New or changed care requirements
        - "Outcome/goal": New goals or desired outcomes
        - "Description of care actions": New or modified care procedures
   iv. Integrate updates seamlessly with existing information
   v. Add information not fitting these sections to "Additional Information"
c. Preserve all original information, adding new details where appropriate
d. Do not add information to sections unless explicitly mentioned in reviews or original content

Comprehensive Example:
Original Subplan Sections:
"Assessed current situations":
- Patient has difficulty walking
- Experiences frequent lower back pain

"Care needs":
- Assistance with mobility
- Pain management for lower back

"Outcome/goal":
- Improve mobility
- Reduce lower back pain

"Description of care actions":
- Provide walker for ambulation
- Administer prescribed pain medication as needed

Recent Review (15/06/2024): 
"Patient now using a walker with good effect. Lower back pain improved with physical therapy, but new onset of dizziness when standing quickly. Recommend blood pressure monitoring and fall prevention measures. Goal is to transition to a cane within 3 months. Continue PT twice weekly."

Updated Subplan Sections:
"Assessed current situations":
- Patient has difficulty walking
- Patient now uses a walker with good effect
- Experiences lower back pain, improved with physical therapy
- New onset of dizziness when standing up quickly

"Care needs":
- Continued assistance with mobility
- Ongoing pain management for lower back
- Fall prevention
- Blood pressure monitoring

"Outcome/goal":
- Improve mobility
- Reduce lower back pain
- Transition from walker to cane within 3 months
- Manage dizziness and prevent falls

"Description of care actions":
- Provide and ensure proper use of walker for ambulation
- Continue physical therapy twice weekly
- Implement fall prevention measures (e.g., clear walkways, use of grab bars)
- Monitor blood pressure regularly, especially when changing positions
- Administer prescribed pain medication as needed
- Educate patient on techniques for safely changing positions to minimize dizziness

This example demonstrates how a single review can lead to updates across all four key sections of the care plan, integrating new information while preserving relevant existing details.
