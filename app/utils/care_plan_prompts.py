## Input:
- Subplans: {subplans}
- Current Date: {current_date}
- Combination Instructions: {combine_instructions}

## Process Overview:
1. Review Identification and Update
2. Content Enhancement and Information Preservation
3. Standardization and Proofreading
4. Review Chronology Correction
5. Subplan Combination Analysis
6. Proofread and Polish the Final Document
7. Final Output Generation in JSON Format

## Detailed Instructions:

### 1. Review Identification and Update
For each subplan:
a. Identify the most recent review(s) by comparing dates to the provided current date: {current_date}.
b. Use this method to compare dates:
   - Compare years first (e.g., 24 for 2024)
   - If years are the same, compare months (01-12)
   - If months are the same, compare days (01-31)
c. Select ALL reviews with the latest date, even if there are multiple entries for the same date.
d. If multiple reviews exist for the most recent date, include ALL of them in your update.
e. Update the care plan with new information from the most recent review(s).
f. Integrate new information into appropriate sections of the original subplan structure.
g. DO NOT add any information to sections unless explicitly mentioned in reviews or original content.

### 2. Content Enhancement and Information Preservation
For each subplan:
a. Improve clarity, coherence, and professionalism of existing content.
b. Fix grammar and spelling mistakes.
c. Expand concise sentences into more detailed, professional descriptions.
d. Ensure all expansions remain factual and based solely on the information provided in the original content.
e. Preserve ALL information, including past reviews, assessments, and events, regardless of where they appear in the original text.
f. Create a new section titled "Additional Information" to capture any information that doesn't fit into the existing sections.

### 3. Standardization and Proofreading
a. Ensure consistent formatting and language across all subplans.
b. Verify that all subplans follow their original structure and section headings.
c. Use consistent terminology for similar concepts across subplans.
d. Proofread the entire document for grammatical errors, paying special attention to:
   - Verb tense consistency
   - Subject-verb agreement

   - Correct use of prepositions
   - Consistent capitalization of proper nouns and at the beginning of sentences
   - Correct and consistent punctuation, including commas, periods, and semicolons

### 4. Review Chronology Correction
a. Collect all reviews from each subplan.
b. Sort the reviews in reverse chronological order, with the most recent review at the top and the oldest review at the bottom.
c. If multiple reviews exist for the same date, maintain their original order within that date.

### 5. Subplan Combination Analysis
a. Review the provided combination instructions: {combine_instructions}
b. Analyze all subplans for similarities based on the combination instructions.
c. If subplans meet the criteria for combination as per the instructions, proceed with combining them.
d. When combining subplans:
   - Merge similar sections while preserving all unique information.
   - Use clear headings to distinguish information from different original subplans.
   - Ensure no information is lost or duplicated in the process.
e. If subplans do not meet the combination criteria, keep them separate.
